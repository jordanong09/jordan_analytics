The finance data shows the timestamp of the participants log and a category column.

We will leverage on the parset library to provide interactive function. The interesting feature about the parset function is that it allows the user to dynamically shift the levels of the attributes (top-bottom and left-right), providing the user a more interactive visualisation of the data set.\n\nactive_participants_parset <- active_participants_grouped %>%\n  select (`Household Size`, `Have Kids`, `Education Level`, `Interest Group`, Income_group, Joviality_group)\n\nparset(active_participants_parset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising using Statistical Graph\nFrom the Parset plot, we identify a few probable relationship such as Education Level to Income Level etc. We will now use statistical plot to verify our claim. The ggstatsplot library provides a suite of statistical plot to allow user to choose the plot based on its data set. For this study, since our attributes are in categorical form, I will leverage on the ggbarstats.\n\nInsights\nPearson’s \\(x^2\\)-test of independence revealed that, across 880 participants,there was a significant association between Income Level, Education Level and Joviality Level. (p-value below alpha value of 0.05). The Bayes Factor for the left analysis revealed that the data were \\(8e^{66}\\) times more probable under the alternative hypothesis as compared to the null hypothesis. This can be considered extreme evidence (Sandra Andraszewicz, 2015) in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The Bayes Factor for the right analysis revealed that the data were 23968348874 times more probable under the alternative hypothesis as compared to the null hypothesis. This can also be considered extreme evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nactive_participants_parset$Income_group <- factor(active_participants_parset$Income_group, levels = c(\n  \"Low Income\", \"Mid-Low Income\", \"Mid-High Income\", \"High Income\"), ordered = TRUE) #create factor data object to segment the Education Level by levels.\n\nincome <- ggbarstats(\n  data = active_participants_parset,\n  x = `Education Level`,\n  y = Income_group,\n  type = \"np\",\n  xlab = \"Income Group\"\n)\n\njoy <- ggbarstats(\n  data = active_participants_parset,\n  x = Joviality_group,\n  y = Income_group,\n  type = \"np\",\n  xlab = \"Income Group\"\n)\n\n\nincome + joy"
